                <h2>USE OF ONOMATOPEIAS</h2>
                <p>Onomatopoeia are words created to represent sounds, movements, or sensations in a direct and intuitive way. They can imitate real noises, such as tick-tock, bang, or splash, or describe more abstract phenomena in an expressive way.
                    Mimetic words, on the other hand, go beyond simple sound reproduction: they represent states, textures, behaviors, emotions, and ways of acting that do not have a natural sound, but which come to life through phonetic constructions.
                    In the Japanese language, these two groups blend together to form an extremely rich system that helps convey meanings in a visual, emotional, and immediate way.

                <p>Onomatopoeia plays an essential role in communication, as it makes descriptions more vivid and engaging. In everyday texts, it reinforces atmospheres and sensations; in comics, it becomes part of the visual narrative, complementing the art; and in speech, it can facilitate the understanding of emotions and actions.
                    In Portuguese, we use onomatopoeia such as knock-knock (knocking on the door), boom (explosion), and chomp (bite), but their use is relatively limited and more closely linked to humor or informality.
                    In Japan, however, the function of these words is much broader, more structured, and more common, directly influencing the way stories are told and communication takes place.
                </p>
                <p>Mimetic words are a fundamental part of the Japanese language and permeate everything from literature to everyday conversation.
                    They allow us to express nuances that are difficult to translate literally, such as bodily sensations (zuki-zuki for throbbing pain), textures (sara-sara for something smooth and silky), behaviors (ura-ura for restlessness), and emotional states (waku-waku for excitement).
                    In addition, they function as a visual communication tool: even without knowing all the grammatical rules, it is possible to grasp the tone and feeling conveyed by the choice of these words.
                    Therefore, learning Japanese onomatopoeia is essential to better understand how Japanese people describe the world around them.
                </p>
                <p>In Japan, mimetic words are used extensively in informal speech, especially in situations such as:
                    describing physical sensations (muka-muka, gara-gara, kira-kira);
                    expressing emotions and internal states (ira-ira, beta-beta, waku-waku);
                    explaining movements and actions (zatto, pyon-pyon, sutoon);
                    narrating everyday life, such as telling something to friends or family.
                    Among all age groups, children and young people are the biggest users of these words, as they learn early on to incorporate them into their vocabulary and use them naturally in social interactions, games, and descriptions.
                    Adults also use onomatopoeia frequently—especially in informal conversations—but tend to choose slightly more specific or moderate terms depending on the context. 
                    Still, compared to other languages, Japanese remains one of the languages in the world that most uses mimetic words in everyday speech, making them an important part of Japanese culture and communication.
