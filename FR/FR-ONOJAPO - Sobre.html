                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Onojapo is a website dedicated to onomatopoeia and mimetic words in the Japanese language, bringing together explanations, examples, and practical uses in both speech and manga. Japanese onomatopoeia goes far beyond simple sounds: it describes sensations, movements, emotions, and states in a visual and intuitive way. The goal of the website is to present this universe in an accessible way, showing how these words work and why they are so important for understanding the expressive way of communicating of the Japanese.
                </p>
                <p>In manga, onomatopoeia plays an essential role in constructing the visual narrative. It reinforces actions, atmospheres, and emotions, functioning as part of the drawing and complementing the sequential art. Onojapo shows how these words are used within the frames, how they integrate with the rhythm of reading, and how they are translated or adapted in foreign versions. This process involves both linguistic choices and graphic decisions, since many onomatopoeias are part of the visual layout of the page.
                </p>
                <p>In everyday speech, Japanese uses onomatopoeia much more frequently than other languages, making it an indispensable part of natural expression. These words describe behaviors, physical sensations, feelings, textures, and even degrees of intensity. The website also presents the five traditional categories of mimetic words: giseigo (animal sounds), giongo (object sounds), gitaigo (states and movements), gijougo (psychological states), and giyougo (ways of acting), explaining their use and offering examples for those who wish to learn Japanese.
