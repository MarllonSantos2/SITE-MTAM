                <h2>iN MANGA</h2>
                <p>Onomatopoeia is one of the most characteristic elements of manga, playing a role that goes beyond the simple representation of sounds. In the context of comics, they function as an integral part of the visual narrative: they describe movements, atmospheres, sensations, and even emotional states in a direct and graphic way. 
                    Unlike other languages, Japanese has a huge variety of mimetic words, which allows for the transmission of very specific nuances.
                    In manga, these words do not appear only as text, but as visual elements that are integrated into the drawing, the framing, and the rhythm of reading.
                </p>
                <p>Onomatopoeia serves multiple purposes in manga: it reinforces actions, intensifies emotions, situates the reader in the environment, and helps convey the energy of the scene.
                    In many cases, it replaces or complements the characters' facial expressions, creating a direct link between the reader and what is happening in the frame.
                    Onomatopoeia can indicate speed, weight, impact, environment, mood, physical sensation, and even subjective elements such as anxiety or surprise.
                    In terms of comic book art, they add dynamism to the page, modulate the narrative tempo, and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the work, whether it is comical, dramatic, violent, or contemplative.
                </p>
                <p>Adapting and translating onomatopoeia in manga into other languages is a complex process that requires a balance between fidelity to the original and readability in the target language.
                    Many Japanese onomatopoeia have no direct equivalent in other languages, forcing translators and designers to recreate sound effects rather than simply translating them literally.
                    In addition, since these words are part of the artwork on the page, the editing team often has to redesign the speech bubbles or replace the text while preserving the original aesthetics.
                </p>
                <p>One of the most notable examples of this process is the official English release of Chainsaw Man, often praised for how it visually adapts Japanese onomatopoeia.
                    The English versions maintain the graphic impact of the sounds, recreating the typography and positioning of the words within the pages.
                    Comparisons between the Japanese and English versions show how these elements can be creatively reinterpreted, maintaining the energy of the original while making reading more natural for speakers of another language.

            </div>

                <p>When comparing the Japanese and English versions of the page, the most obvious highlight is the adaptation of the large onomatopoeia that accompanies the sword strike of the character Yoru.
                    In the original Japanese, the sound effect integrates naturally into the flow of the action lines, using broad white strokes that cut across the scene horizontally, reinforcing the speed, impact, and trajectory of the attack.
                    In the English version, the adaptation team recreates this typographic effect by replacing the Japanese characters with “SLASH,” preserving the same direction, the same visual volume, and even the style of worn edges that simulate movement.
                    This reinterpretation maintains the narrative role of onomatopoeia without reducing its graphic power, showing how manga translation can go beyond literal text replacement: it is a work of visual recreation that must respect the rhythm, composition, and intensity of the page.
                    Let's look at another example!
                </p>
            
            <div class="imagem">
                <img src="/assets/kagurabachi103-eng.png" class="zoomable" alt="Imagem ilustrativa">
            </div>

                <p>In the example of Kagurabachi, we see a different solution to the same translation challenge: instead of redesigning or graphically replacing the Japanese onomatopoeia, the team chose to keep them intact in the original artwork, adding small translations next to each sound effect.
                    This approach fully preserves the mangaka's calligraphic style and respects the visual impact of the brushstrokes, which are part of the aesthetic strength of the work. At the same time, it ensures accessibility to foreign readers through discreet notes, inserted in such a way as not to interfere with the composition of the frames.
                    Both this solution and the one found in Chainsaw Man are valid ways of translating onomatopoeia, and the choice between one or the other may depend on several factors: tight weekly publication schedules (as is the case with Kagurabachi), production limitations, editorial decisions, contractual guidelines, or even the aesthetic intention of the team responsible for editing.
                    Each method has specific advantages and reflects different priorities within the visual adaptation process in the international manga market.
